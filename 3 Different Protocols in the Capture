So, in this step, I focused on filtering TCP traffic in Wireshark and identified 3 different TCP-based protocols that I captured. Here's what I found:
1. HTTP (Port 80)

    I filtered the traffic for TCP, and one of the first things I found was HTTP traffic. This was a GET request for www.google.com.

    Details: This HTTP packet was a regular request my browser sent to load the homepage of Google. The source was my machine, and the destination was Google's server, all happening over TCP port 80.

2. HTTPS (Port 443)

    I also spotted HTTPS traffic, which was encrypted. I saw a Client Hello message as part of the TLS handshake.

    Details: This packet was the beginning of a secure HTTPS connection, where my browser was setting up a secure connection with Google over TCP port 443. The handshake process starts with a Client Hello, which is part of the SSL/TLS encryption process.

3. DNS Over TCP (Port 53)

    Another thing I found was DNS traffic. Normally DNS uses UDP, but in my case, it was using TCP (probably because of a large response or DNSSEC).

    Details: I saw a DNS query for www.google.com to resolve the domain name. This was over TCP port 53, which is less common but still something I had to capture.
